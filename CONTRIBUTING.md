# Contributing to Learn Anything

Thank you for taking the time to contribute! ♥️

Currently, the code for the new version is being worked on in private (until we figure out how to make development work locally for everyone).

We welcome you to join our community on [Discord](https://discord.gg/KKYdWjt) to learn & build this project together.

There is some code in the repo now but it relies on Hasura & Postgres (with certain schema) to work.

## Tech stack

- [NextJS](https://nextjs.org) for rendering things
- [PostgresDB](https://www.postgresql.org) to store all the data
- [Hasura](https://hasura.io) for GraphQL API on top of Postgres DB
- [Go](https://golang.org) for all things backend (Hasura actions, ..)
