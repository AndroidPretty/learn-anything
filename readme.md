## What is it

The vision of project is to create the best platform possible for learning any topic as well as finding & building novel ideas together.

If you are interested in helping us out, please join our community on [Discord](https://discord.gg/KKYdWjt) to learn & build this project together.

The code for last release of Learn Anything deployed at [learn-anything.xyz](https://learn-anything.xyz) can be found [here](https://github.com/learn-anything/2017-release). You are welcome to do anything you wish with it.

## Help us build it

We share most of our plans & docs in public as we build the project out. We author everything in Notion & all our public documents can be viewed [here](https://www.notion.so/learnany/Public-b3b8e046a6bc44549367b84423360b93).

Our tech stack is:

- [NextJS](https://nextjs.org) for rendering things on the web.
- [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org) to store all the data.
- [Hasura](https://hasura.io) for GraphQL API on top of Postgres.
- [Go](https://golang.org) for all things backend (Hasura actions, serverless functions).

If you wish to join our team, we would love to have you but currently we lack any funds to support anyone. We hope that changes in the near future as we release the website.

If you wish to invest in the project please contact [Nikita](https://nikitavoloboev.xyz). Thank you. ❤️
